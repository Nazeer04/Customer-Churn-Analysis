🔍 **Project Overview**  

The project focuses on identifying key factors influencing customer churn and retention within a telecommunications company. The goal is to provide actionable insights through data visualization to help the Telecommunications Retention Manager design effective strategies to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.


🗂️ **Dataset**  
The dataset contains information related to:

  - Customer demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen)

  - Subscription details (Internet Service, Contract Type, Tenure)

  - Services used (Tech Support, Online Security)

  - Payment methods

  - Churn status (Yes/No)

📌**Dataset Origin: PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship on Forage**

🛠️ **Tools & Techniques**  

  - Power BI: For data modeling, transformation, and dashboard development

  - Power Query: For cleaning and preparing the data

  - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For in-depth metrics and calculated columns/measures

  - Star Schema Modeling: For efficient data relationships

  - Dashboard Design: For interactive insights and business storytelling

⚙️ **Data Preparation Steps**  

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and handled missing values.

2. **Data Modeling**: Structured the data using relationships and star schema.

3. **DAX Implementation**: Built key metrics like retention rate, churn rate, revenue summaries, and tenure analysis.

4. **Dashboard Design**: Developed an interactive dashboard with slicers and KPIs.

5. **Insight Extraction**: Analyzed patterns and churn triggers.

📈 **Key Insights**
1️⃣ **Overview**
  - 📌 Total Customers: **7,043**

  - ✅ Retained Customers: **5,174 (73.46%)**

  - ❌ Churned Customers: **1,869 (26.54%)**

  - 💰 Yearly Charges: **$16.06M**, Monthly Charges: **$456.12K**

  - 🛠️ Support Tickets: **2955 Tech, 3632 Admin**

  - 👵 Senior Citizens: **16.21%** of total, **25.46%** of churned customers

2️⃣ **Demographics**  
- Fiber Optic users show a high churn rate of **69.39%**

- Average Tenure:

  - Overall: **32.37 months**

  - Churned: **17.89 months**

- Low tenure = higher churn risk

3️⃣ **Subscriptions & Services**  

- Churn is higher among customers:

  - Without Tech Support or Online Security

  - On Month-to-Month contracts

- Longer tenure plans show better retention

- Customers with fewer services are more likely to churn

✅ **Recommendations**  

1. 🎯 Promote One-Year and Two-Year contracts with attractive incentives

2. 💸 Offer targeted discounts for Month-to-Month customers

3. 🔐 Educate users on benefits of Online Security and Tech Support

4. 📈 Set goals to:

  - Increase 1-Year & 2-Year contracts by 5%

  - Boost yearly auto-payment subscriptions by 5%

📌 **Outcome**  

This project helped me improve my Power BI skills, especially in dashboarding, DAX, and data storytelling. It also reinforced how data-driven insights can drive real business value in areas like customer experience and revenue retention.
